"<p>Taxes follow us from birth until death. For most of us, our life time tax bill will be our single biggest expenditure.

Tax sensitive investments<br/>4. Tax related diversification<br/>5. Proper tax planning for retirement<br/>6. The “Gain” on capital gains<br/>7. Alternative tax-free plans<br/>8. Tax sensitive investing and strategies<br/>9. How will your retirement income be taxed<br/>10. Ways to a lower tax bracket for lower and higher income earners<br/>11. Taxation of social security benefits</p> <p>This workshop is free, non-solicitous, and 100% educational.
